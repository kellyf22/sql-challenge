# sql-challenge

Super excited for my first assignment for Pewlett Hackard! I've been given six CSVs that are the only remnants of the employee database from the 80s and 90s. 

First, I inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables using Quick Database Diagrams. [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/DE46N8)

Then I created a table schema for each of the six CSV files and imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table to make a SQL database.

Next I queried my database to list the following:

1. Details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
2. First name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986. (My brother's birth year!)
3. The manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
4. The department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. First name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" (my favorite Disney movie!) and last names beginning with "B."
6. All employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
7. All employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. In descending order, the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

I have a hunch there's something suspicious about this dataset, but I can't quite put my finger on it...
